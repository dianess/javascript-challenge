Link to website: [UFO Sightings](https://dianess.github.io/javascript-challenge/)

In this challenge, I used JavaScript and d3 to append a table of data containing UFO sightings to a web page. This page also allows a user to enter a date, city, state, or shape and receive the table information for each sighting that matches their input.
